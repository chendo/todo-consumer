Todo Consumer Example

Go to the provider's /oauth_clients (eg http://todo-provider.heroku.com/oauth_clients) and register your application and supply the correct info.

Let's say your app was http://todo-consumer.heroku.com/

Main application URL: http://todo-consumer.heroku.com
Callback URL: http://todo-consumer.heroku.com/oauth_consumers/todo/callback

Get the Key and Secret from this page and slap them in config/credentials.todo.yml (look at the example)
Once this is done, it should work.
